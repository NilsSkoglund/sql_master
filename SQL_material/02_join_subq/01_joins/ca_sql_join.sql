-- Introducing JOIN
-- If we want to combine information that is stored accross multiple tables,
-- we have to use JOIN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- We have to declare with ON what value describes the relationship between
-- both tables. Also called the key.
SELECT *
FROM emp.employees
INNER JOIN emp.salaries
    ON emp.emp_no = salaries.emp_no;


-- We can make this easier to type (but somewhat harder to read) with AS
-- Still, this is generally best practice to do.
SELECT *
FROM emp.employees AS s
INNER JOIN emp.salaries AS e
    ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no;


-------------------------------- no codealong ---------------------------------

-- Code to create table "mini_emp"
SELECT *
FROM emp.employees
WHERE emp_no IN (54342, 294868)

-- Show the students the mini_emp table and what it contains
SELECT *

-- JOINS work according to the rules of set theory.
-- They can be visualized with Venn diagrams. **Show cheat sheet**
-- INNER and LEFT joins most commonly used joins
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Introducing INNER JOIN
-- The intersection between the left (A) and right (B) table
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- There is no record of emp_no 294868 in the salaries table.
-- So it won't included when we are doing an INNER JOIN
-- This is the most generally useful JOIN
-- Make sure this makes sense to everyone. Refer to cheat sheet.
SELECT *
FROM emp.mini_emp AS A
INNER JOIN emp.salaries AS B
    ON A.emp_no = B.emp_no;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Column name ... is ambiguous
-- A problem that shows up when we start using JOINs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ,first_name
    ,last_name
    ,salary
FROM emp.mini_emp AS me
INNER JOIN emp.salaries AS s
    ON me.emp_no = s.emp_no;

-- This is ambigious and leads to errors
-- emp_no exists in both:
    -- the mini_emp table
    -- and the salaries table
-- Therefore... ambiguous!


-- dealing with ambiguity in select
-- Specify a table name before the column name
-- for emp_no it is nessecary, for the others it's good practice

    ,me.first_name
    ,me.last_name

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Introducing LEFT JOIN
-- Everything from A (left) including the intersection with B (right)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- With the LEFT JOIN we are always including the records from the left table
-- Keys without any info in B will simply have NULL there instead
-- The left table is the first table. So mini_emp in this case
-- Make sure this makes sense to everyone. Refer to cheat sheet.
SELECT *
FROM emp.mini_emp AS A
LEFT JOIN emp.salaries AS B
    ON A.emp_no = B.emp_no;


-- Adding in IS NULL 
SELECT *
FROM emp.mini_emp AS A
LEFT JOIN emp.salaries AS B
    ON A.emp_no = B.emp_no
WHERE B.salary IS NULL;
-- IS NULL can be used on any column in the right table 

-- Let's say we wan't to get all employee numbers ...
-- ... for employees that never received a salary 

-- just change mini_emp to employees
SELECT *
FROM emp.employees AS A
LEFT JOIN emp.salaries AS B
    ON A.emp_no = B.emp_no
WHERE B.salary IS NULL;

-- Being a bit more specific with DISTINCT(A.emp_no)
SELECT DISTINCT(A.emp_no)
FROM emp.employees AS A
LEFT JOIN emp.salaries AS B
    ON A.emp_no = B.emp_no
WHERE B.salary IS NULL;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Summary LEFT JOIN
-- Everything from A (left table) 
-- Add in records from B (right table)
-- Rows from A without any info in B will have NULL there instead
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- INNER JOINs are much more commonly used 
-- We don't even have to specify the INNER part
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT *
FROM emp.mini_emp AS A
-- JOIN = INNER JOIN
    JOIN emp.salaries AS B
    ON A.emp_no = B.emp_no;
-- Show student's that the result is the same
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Lets find out some more info about our two employees
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- what is the title for all employees?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- We can also combine multiple JOINS in one query
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- what is the name of the department?
-- We need to match mini_emp with dept_emp using emp_no
    -- to get the dept_no
-- Then we need to match dept_emp with departments on dept_no
    -- to get the dept_name from departments
SELECT me.first_name

--------------------------- Data Cleaning Wrap Up -----------------------------
-- We wanted to calculate the average salaries of "senior engineers"

-- We only wanted to look at current salary data
